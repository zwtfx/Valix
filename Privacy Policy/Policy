Hello users of Valix! This is our bots Privacy Policy:

1. Data We Collect
Valix is designed to minimize data collection.

User-Provided Data: We collect the Roblox User IDs or Usernames you manually input into commands like /evaluate-id.

Discord Metadata: When you run a command, we temporarily process your Discord User ID and Server ID to deliver the response.

Roblox Data: We fetch public data from the Roblox API (Inventory, RAP, account status, and badges).

2. How We Use Data
To provide the "Evaluation" service requested by the user.

To troubleshoot bugs or errors in the bot's code.

We do not sell, rent, or trade any user data to third parties.

3. Data Retention
Command Logs: We may keep temporary logs of command usage (who ran what command and when) for a period of up to 30 days to prevent abuse and spam.

No Persistent Storage: We do not maintain a permanent database of Roblox inventories or Discord user profiles.

4. Data Security
We use industry-standard practices to ensure your data is handled securely. When hosted (e.g., via Railway), your data is protected by the host's security infrastructure.

5. Third-Party Services
Valix interacts with the following third-party APIs:

Discord API: For bot functionality and interaction.

Roblox API: To retrieve account and inventory information.

Rolimons API: (If applicable) for item valuation and thumbnails.
Please consult the respective privacy policies of these services for more information.

6. User Rights & Contact
If you wish to have your data removed from our temporary logs or have questions regarding this policy, please contact the bot developer via Discord.
